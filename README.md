Hello.
  

I'm a huge nerd that loves to make things.  More specifically, I'm a software engineer and artist in Seattle.
  
  
Learning a new language or technologies to solve a problem domain is basically studying ancient tongues to scribe spells.  HttpRequest, more like Neo-Electrical Telekinesis.  Writing code is wizardry, and who doesn't want to be a wizard.
